Your application {{.AppName}} has been automatically scaled up from {{.FromInstanceCount}} instances to {{.ToInstanceCount}},
because the current average CPU usage of {{.CPUUtilization}}% is over your threshold of {{.CPUMaxThreshold}}% during the last {{.PlanDuration}}.
If load continues to increase, we will automatically increase the scale of your application
(1 instance at a time) until your previously defined maximum of {{.MaxInstanceCount}} instances. If load decreases,
we will scale your application down until your minimum of {{.MinInstanceCount}} instances.
