<p>
    Your application <b>{{.AppName}}</b> has been automatically <b>scaled up from {{.FromInstanceCount}} instances to {{.ToInstanceCount}}</b>,
    because the current average CPU usage of {{.CPUUtilization}}% is over your
    threshold of {{.CPUMaxThreshold}}% during the last {{.PlanDuration}}.
</p>
<p>
    If load continues to increase, we will automatically increase the scale of your
    application (1 instance at a time) until your previously defined maximum of
    {{.MaxInstanceCount}} instances. If load decreases, we will scale your application
    down until your minimum of {{.MinInstanceCount}} instances.
